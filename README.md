Data Used: AudioMNIST, Librispeech.

Training was done only on AudioMNIST (96% Accuracy), the test function only works on MNIST.

App.py: Tkinter app that let's the user record their own voice saying a number and tests the model on it, note that the audio needs to be clean (it barely works).

I will add more to the ReadME once I have time.

I assume that the Notebook works, you don't have to download the MNIST dataset
